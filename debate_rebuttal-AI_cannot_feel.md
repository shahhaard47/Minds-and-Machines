Debate:
> **Inanimate**: the organization of mechanical processes is sufficient to explain life (**MY POSITION**)

> **Animate**: life processes require an appeal to scenes, souls, drives, a will, a vital force, or some other processes beyond mere mechanical organization 

#### Inanimate Rebuttal (*my argument*)
You raise a few good points, however I feel differently about the feeling emotions argument. It is important to define what are feelings? I agree that there are two forms, but they are not disjoint; I believe what today's science has shown: that they [stem from our brain](https://www.neurologytimes.com/blog/how-brain-processes-emotions) (the limbic system), "internally" as you put it, and they are expressed "externally" by the host in response to the brain's command. With that said, if an AI could perfectly mimic both the internal and external aspects, would there be any distinction? ([Top Five Emotion / Sentiment Analysis softwares](https://medium.com/@sifium/top-five-emotional-sentiment-analysis-apis-116cd8d42055))

Finally, emotions also serve a purpose; they can motivate people to sprout them into action, the good and the bad emotions can serve as a feedback mechanism for what to do and what not to do ([Purpose of Emotions](http://www.changeminds.org/explanations/emotions/emotion_purpose.htm#So): also mentions there are more negative emotions then positive because they are designed to keep us alive). So, while it is true that emotions are a very advantageous evolutionary functions of our beings and it is unclear whether AI will ever be able to replicate them, it is erroneous to not recognize their presence as something evolutionary and learnt for the purpose of our survival.

#### Animate Argument (paraphrased):

*Emotion is our vital force*
> Some key things do not need to be taught: Feeling emotion. Feeling emotion can be external (crying) or internal form ("mentall feeling happy/sad"), is not something taught by society by parenting. "While babies don't have a sense of self, they do have these key elements that would support that we are more animate than a robot that has to be taught/evolved to be animate.

*Humans have an immediate and obvious sensation that cannot be felt by a piece of AI that need to be taught to feel*
> As for the argument that emotion and our physical responses are all just mechanisms of the body, to some extent I saw what the inanimate side was trying to get at. Everything that happens in our body has a biological basis. *However*, while it has a biological basis, it is the response in our bodies that still *separates* us. After all, when we feel physical pain or sorrow or joy, there is an immediate and obvious sensation that *cannot* be felt by a piece of AI that has been taught to feel emotion. It can outwardly respond as we do, but does it feel the way we or any living sentient being does? I would think not. So I think that there is some sense of animation that separates us from any robot that is considered purely made of mechanisms.
