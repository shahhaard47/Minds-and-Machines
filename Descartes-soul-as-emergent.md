# Descartes' Soul as Emergent System
> Author: Haard Shah

In his first book, *Treatise of man*, Descartes states “First I must describe the body on its own; then the soul, again on its own; and finally I must show how these two natures would have to be joined and united in order to constitute men who resemble us.” As we learn from perusing the literature, Descartes doesn’t exactly deliver on these promises [1]. In *The Passions of the Soul*, Descartes attributes “a little gland in the innermost part of the brain” as the location where the soul exercises its functions. Descartes explains how seeing does not take place at the sensors (eyes) but after the “spirits” process the image into a particular format, the pineal gland “acts directly upon the soul and makes it see the shape of the animal” [2]. As stated in the analysis on *René Descartes* by Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), I too think that Descartes’ argument about the mind being immaterial is flawed and can be explained with complex material systems [3].

In the *Discourse*, Descartes makes the argument that he can doubt the existence of material world, but cannot doubt the existence of himself as a thinking thing (“*Cogito, ergo sum*” – “I think, therefore I am”). Using this, he concludes that the mind or soul is nonspatial substance. As stated in the SEP analysis, Descartes’ argument “relies on conceivability based in ignorance. He has not included anything in the argument to ward off the possibility that he, as a think thing, is in fact a complex material system” [3]. His argument is inconclusive because he just relied on the fact that he can doubt the existence of matter to conclude that matter is distinct from mind, without entertaining the possibility that mind could be made up of matter. Incidentally in *The Passions of the Soul*, Descartes’ examples about seeing section 35, “[how] impressions of objects are united in the gland in the middle of the brain,” and feeling flight or fight response in section 36, “[how] are passions aroused in the soul,” can be refuted using just this fact.

First, Descartes uses an example of an animal approaching us to describe the process by which we see or our “soul” sees. He says that once the light reflected from the animal’s body enters our eyes and the optic nerves transfer the image to the internal surface of the brain, the “spirits” that surround the “little gland” carry the two images from both eyes, combine the images using common features and report this unified image to the gland as one image. He concludes, “In this way, the two images in the brain form only one image on the gland, which acts directly upon the soul and makes it see the shape of the animal” [2]. SEP [1] shows very clearly how this example is flawed anatomically. I would like to focus on the combination of the two images and their representation as a single image giving us the notion of seeing one animal and not two. The function of merging the two images using identical features can be attributed to the emergent nature of our neural system made up of some 100 billion neurons [4, 6]. Furthermore, the representation of the final image giving us the notion of seeing is can also be attributed to the complex mesh of neurons that encode this information.  

Second, Descartes uses the same image to describe the response of the “soul.” He even explains the impact our past plays in our reaction to strange and terrifying image. If the image matches our memory of things that have been harmful in the past, it will initiate a fight or flight response: “this arouses the passion of anxiety in the soul, and then that of courage or perhaps fear and terror, depending on the particular temperament of the body or the strength of the soul” [2]. This response can be attributed to the adaptive property of complex or emergent systems. Complex systems, such as our brains, can adapt by learning or evolving to meet the needs for surviving in our environment [6]. So, the individual’s past here could have altered the physical structure or arrangement of their neural structure leading to a behavior. 

I understand that this is recent discovery and complexity theory itself is a novel concept; nonetheless, a complex material system can substitute for the immaterial soul or spirits.

## Descartes' Immaterial Soul and His Era
> Another classmates' response

I think this a prime example how who knowledge from the current era and knowledge from the previous eras can have such a stark contrast. Especially since we are living in a time where modern scientific research and medical methodologies rule over philosophers spending a majority of the day determining the "causes" for many of the "effects". Descartes explanation of how the mind interprets objects and people in the external world sounds foreign or mainly incorrect, primarily because we have the correct information from ophthalmology. To play devil's advocate, I believe Descartes' understanding of visual interpretation, immaterial, and philosophical topics may be the fault of his religious beliefs. From what we have learned in class, Descartes was a philosopher but also a believer in God. Perhaps, much of the terminology and reasoning he created was religiously influenced in a way. While he does believe that the soul is a brain gland, he places a lot emphasis on the soul and with spirits.  In my perspective, an example of this action can be seen in one of your sentences: "First, Descartes uses an example of an animal approaching us to describe the process by which we see or our “soul” sees" . After reading this sentence, I believe Descartes places some sort of agency with the human soul, as if the soul is somewhat automatic or it governs its own self by its own principles/laws. 

Another reason, I felt that Descartes may just be responding to the information provided in his time, is when you stated that Descartes theory was "...flawed anatomically". If we are going by the data provided from anatomical science, Descartes doesn't have a fair advantage at all. While I think your opinion on a complex material system can be valid - I do think it is important to note the limited knowledge of Descartes era.

## Descartes' anatomical flaws (response to above)
> Author: Haard

I agree, Descartes' religious beliefs might have influenced his Dualism theory and the function that "soul" plays in our brains. However, in response to the "flawed anatomically", my intention was to just refer to SEP (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) which explains the flaws in Descartes' image of our mind very clearly (full article: Descartes and the Pineal Gland). The encyclopedia provides a comprehensive analysis on the knowledge known about the Pineal Gland before Descartes (Pre-cartesian), during Descartes (his views), and after Descartes (Post-Cartesian). The article mentions Descartes' Views on the Pineal Gland, and states "Unfortunately, however, some of Descartes’ basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by our standards, but also in light of what was already known in his time." I think it is helpful to look at what was known during the Pre-Cartesian time to gain a better understanding of how Descartes' image is flawed.
When I did my class notes, I read an excerpt from Descartes' Passions of the Soul, from David Chalmers' Philosophy of Mind. I was really confused by Descartes' examples of where our desires arise from and how we perceive our environment because it sounded very much like what we believe right now; however, in his model of the brain, our neural signals in our brain are replaced by "spirits" and the brain's center is replaced depicted as the location of the "soul". See attached image from the same encyclopedia article about Descartes' view of the Pineal Gland: Figure 6. The Pineal Gland According to Descartes. This image from the 1664 edition of the Treatise of man illustrates Descartes’ view that the pineal gland (H) is suspended in the middle of the ventricles (Descartes 1664, p. 63).
